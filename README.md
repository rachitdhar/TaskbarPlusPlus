# TaskbarPlusPlus

A clean and customizable taskbar for Windows, that displays the currently open apps. Built primarily with the interest to change the dock position of the taskbar (something that Windows does not allow anymore in the built-in taskbar). Also added the ability to modify the colors.

The taskbar is kept as minimal as possible. Consequently, the code for it is pretty straightforward. It can be modified to suit ones personal interests and likings if so desired.

## Buttons

- TOP / LEFT Toggle : To change the dock position of the taskbar
- +/- Toggle : To make the taskbar (and its icons) big / small
- Color change (>>) : To change to a different color theme (Built-in options are TRANSPARENT, GRAY, WHITE, and BLACK)

There is also a close button (X) which closes the taskbar application, removing it from the screen.
Next to it is a 24-hour clock showing the live time.
