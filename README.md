# TaskbarPlusPlus

A clean and customizable taskbar for Windows. Built primarily with the interest to change the dock position of the taskbar (something that Windows does not allow anymore in the built-in taskbar). Also added the ability to modify the colors.

The taskbar is kept as minimal as possible. Consequently, the code for it is pretty straightforward. It can be modified to suit ones personal interests and likings if so desired.
